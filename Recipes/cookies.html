    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> <li>½ cup (113 g) unsalted butter</li> <li>2 oz (57 g) cream cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar</li> 
    <li> ¼ cup (50 g) light brown sugar firmly packed</li>
    <li>1 large egg </li> <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> <li>2 cups (225 g) cake flour</li>
    <li> 1 Tablespoon cornstarch </li> <li>1 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li> <li> 1 cup (158 g) fresh blueberries </li></ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol> <li> In a large mixing bowl (or bowl of a stand mixer), combine butter, cream cheese, and sugars and use an electric mixer to beat until well-creamed, light, and fluffy (at least a minute on high speed).</li>
        <li>Add egg and vanilla extract and stir until completely combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet, stirring on low-speed until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add blueberries and use a spatula to gently fold into the batter until well distributed.</li>
        <li>Scoop dough by level 1 ½ Tablespoon sized scoop and drop on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Grab a handful of streusel (about a heaping tablespoon) and press firmly onto the top of the cookie dollop. Scoop another level 1 ½ Tablespoon-sized scoop of dough and drop directly on top of the streusel. Portion out another handful of streusel and press gently but firmly on top of the dough to slightly flatten the cookie and to embed the streusel into the cookie.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining cookie dough, spacing cookies at least 2” apart on baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in center rack of 350F (175C) oven for about 15 minutes and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cookie comes out clean or with moist crumbs. Allow to cool completely on baking sheet before drizzling with glaze.</li>
